This folder contains program for the mobile app side of the project, 
It is recommended to run the main.py file directly.
Focus on working in the file designated to you and try to avoid looking and changing the data in other files to prevent confusion.

Files purpose:
- main.py ~ This is the main/ central part of the program, run directly.
- check.py ~ This file checks if a certain module is present or not in the device. If not present it will do the installation.
- pages.py ~ This is just the GUI of the introduction pages, it is kept in separate file to improve readability.
- back.py ~ This file handles the backend part of the program, where it handles data from main.py and gives to database, does some processing and return new data back to main.py
